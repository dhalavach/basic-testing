### Basic testing task for Node.js course (RS School, 2023)

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) latest LTS version if you don't have it on your machine yet
2. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:dhalavach/basic-testing.git` or `git clone https://github.com/dhalavach/basic-testing.git`
3. Go to folder `basic-testing`
4. To install all dependencies run `npm install`
5. Run **test scripts** in command line  `npm run test`
6. You will see the number of skipped, passing and failing tests.

I did not bother creating dev branch and pull request, all code is on master; just clone the repo and test!
