### Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Go to folder `basic-testing`
4. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`]
5. Run **test scripts** in command line ( npm run test )
6. You will see the number of skipped, passing and failing tests.

I did not bother creating dev branch and pull request, all code is on master; just clone the repo and test!
